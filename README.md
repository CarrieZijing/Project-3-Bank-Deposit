## Project Description
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit. \
So we need to clean the data so that it could be used for the analysis.

## Workflow
We use Jira to plan the project, and each step as a Trello card, you can find more details in the workflow chart screeshot in the repo.\
For python coding part, we use Jupyter Notebook on both ends, and merge the codes together.\
For slides, we use Google docs to collaborate.
