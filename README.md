## Project Description
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit. \
So we need to clean the data so that it could be used for the analysis.

## Workflow
We use Jira to plan the project, and each step as a Trello card.\
For python coding part, we use Jupyter Notebook on both ends, and merge the codes together.\
For slides, we use Google docs to collaborate.
